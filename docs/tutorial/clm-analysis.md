# Analysis workflow tutorial

This tutorial shows the workflow to automate the analysis of CLM outputs. This workflow is the second part of `clm-workflow`; it analyzes the outputs after successful completion of the CLM simulation workflow. However, this workflow is intended to be able to run seperately from the first part. If you have outputs from a previous CLM run, you should be able to use this workflow to analyze it.
