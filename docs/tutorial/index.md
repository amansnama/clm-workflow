# Workflow Tutorial

The tutorial is seperated into three options based on which part(s) of the workflow the user will be running. It assumes the user will be running the workflow in a NCAR machine, specifically `derecho`. The advantages of running in a NCAR machine in comparison to a local machine are:

1. CLM simulations are computationally intensive and perform poorly in local machines or servers. NCAR hosts advanced supercomputing systems where they develop and test CLM.
2. Inputs required to run CLM simulations take a huge space. A 40 year simulation could require ~500GB of atmospheric forcing data. The memory requirements also increase exponentially with finer resolution.
