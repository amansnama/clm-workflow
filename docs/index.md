# Welcome to the clm-workflow documentation

**clm-workflow** automates the steps to run Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) hosted at [CTSM](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM).It also automates CLM output analysis, if you want it to. :)

> **NOTE**: The first part of the workflow is complete and works. The second part (CLM analysis) is under preparation.

## Documentation structure

1. [Workflow Tutorial](tutorial/index.md)
2. [Workflow User's Guide](user-guide/index.md)
3. [Workflow Reference](reference/index.md)

## Workflow Components

The workflow contains two main components:

1. CLM simulation automation
2. Analysis automation

    > **NOTE**: This workflow is still in development. The scripts for analysis are available in the repo, but they have not been implemented in Snakemake. The documentation is also in development.
